Hi there, I'm Eduardo

<bold>ABOUT ME: </bold>

Coding provides a space for creativity. I enjoy being challenged in showcasing visual tempos. I like rendering thoughts onto an application and being able to create links that are effective through animation. My achievements are shown in the continuous change in my applications. I am driven by theatrics that draw clients to a website. I like clean lines that are simple yet intrinsic. My strengths are in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 

Aside from tech I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I am a big gamer of all genres and I place my artistic skills on paper.
